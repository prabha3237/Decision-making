# Input the last two digits of the birth year
birth_year_last_two = int(input("Enter your birth year (last 2 digits): "))
# Input the last two digits of the current year
current_year_last_two = int(input("Enter the current year (last 2 digits): "))

# Calculate the full years
if current_year_last_two >= birth_year_last_two:
    age = current_year_last_two - birth_year_last_two
else:
    age = (100 + current_year_last_two) - birth_year_last_two  # Account for the century change

# Output the user's current age
print(f"Your current age is: {age} years")
